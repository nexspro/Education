# Chapter 1: Ruby Basics

### What I did
- Printed text to the console using `puts`.  
- Defined a simple method (`sum`) that demonstrates polymorphic behavior of the `+` operator.  
- Called the method with integers and strings to see addition vs concatenation.  
- Used string interpolation with `Time.now` to include dynamic values in output.  
- Removed leading and trailing whitespace from strings with `.strip`.  

### Key Concepts
- **Console output**: `puts` prints strings and adds a newline automatically.  
- **Methods**: define reusable code blocks with `def ... end`.  
- **Polymorphic operators**: the `+` method works differently depending on the object type.  
- **String interpolation**: embed Ruby expressions directly inside strings with `#{...}`.  
- **Time**: `Time.now` returns the current system time; `strftime` can format it.  
- **String cleanup**: `.strip` removes spaces, tabs, and newlines from both ends of a string.
