# Chapter 2: Collections, Conditionals & Blocks

### What I did
- Worked with strings: `length`, `index`, interpolation, concatenation, and formatting with `.capitalize`.  
- Practiced integer operations like absolute value (`.abs`).  
- Defined simple classes (`Tune`, `Deck`, `Box`) and created objects from them.  
- Built arrays with mixed data types, modified elements, and inspected results.  
- Created hashes with both string and symbol keys, including histograms with default values.  
- Wrote methods with string interpolation, capitalization, and return values.  
- Used conditionals with `if`, `elsif`, and inline `if` syntax.  
- Implemented loops: `while`, `times`, `upto`, and `each` with arrays and ranges.  
- Applied regular expressions for matching and substitution using `=~`, `match?`, `sub`, and `gsub`.  
- Wrote custom methods that use `yield`, including passing parameters to blocks.  
- Replaced interactive input (`gets`) with predefined arrays/strings to simulate console input.  
- Handled command-line arguments with `ARGV` and printed results.  

### Key Concepts
- **Strings**: length, index, interpolation, concatenation, escape sequences, capitalization  
- **Integers**: absolute value (`.abs`)  
- **Collections**: arrays & hashes for storing and modifying data  
- **Hash keys**: symbols vs. strings, histograms with default values  
- **OOP**: classes, objects, attributes, methods  
- **Methods**: definitions, return values, string formatting  
- **Conditionals**: `if`, `elsif`, inline `if`  
- **Loops & iterators**: `while`, `times`, `upto`, `each`, ranges  
- **Regex**: alternation, grouping, word boundaries, substitutions  
- **Blocks & yield**: inline blocks, multi-line blocks, passing parameters  
- **Input/Output**: console simulation with arrays, command-line arguments (`ARGV`)
