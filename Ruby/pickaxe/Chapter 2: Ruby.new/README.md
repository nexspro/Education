# Exercise 2 Collections, Conditionals & Blocks

### What I did
Created and modified arrays with mixed data types.  
Built hashes using both string and symbol keys.  
Defined simple classes (`Song`, `Player`, `Box`) and called their methods.  
Wrote custom methods with string interpolation and return values.  
Wrote conditional statements with `if`, `elsif`, and inline `if`.  
Used different loops: `while`, `times`, `upto`, and `each` with ranges.  
Practiced regular expressions for matching and substitution with `sub` and `gsub`.  
Implemented blocks using `yield` inside custom methods.  
Replaced interactive input (`gets`) with predefined arrays/strings to simulate console input.  
Handled command-line arguments using `ARGV`.  

### Key Concepts
Arrays & hashes for storing collections  
Symbols vs. strings as hash keys  
Classes & objects with attributes and methods  
Method definition and string interpolation  
Conditional branching with `if` / `elsif` / inline `if`  
Iteration using loops, iterators, and ranges  
Regular expressions for pattern matching & replacements  
Blocks and `yield` for dynamic code execution  
Input/Output simulation and command-line arguments (`ARGV`)
