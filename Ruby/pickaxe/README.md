# Ruby Pickaxe Exercises ![Ruby](https://img.shields.io/badge/ruby-3.4%2B-red)

This repository contains my step-by-step Ruby practice exercises inspired by the *Pickaxe* book.  
Each chapter includes an `exercise.rb` file with code examples and a `README.md` explaining what I did and the key concepts learned.

## Key Takeaways

Build Ruby programs incrementally, chapter by chapter.  
Practice both fundamental syntax and object-oriented concepts.  
Use comments and README files to document not just *what* the code does, but *why*.  
Keep exercises structured for clarity and long-term reference.
